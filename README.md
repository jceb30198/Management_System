## Description
A command line application that can be used to manage employee databases using SQL and Node. The application allows the user to add roles, employees, and departments, along with removing or updating any of the previously mentioned categories. Inquirer prompts the questions that the user will need in order to manage the database, and the Console.Table package is used to neatly display the data in the commmand line. SQL is the database language used in order to store all of the user's employee information.
